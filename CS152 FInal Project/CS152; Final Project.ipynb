    "# CS152 Final Project\n",
    "# Gesture Controlled PC\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The main purpose of this assignment is to build a robot that (when connected to PC) enables you to control certain movement on your PC with your hands gestures. This feature has recently been introduced in some updated laptops and PC systems but its very costly and requires the user to understand and learn all the gestures if he wants to navigate through his computer efficiently. Moreover, this feature comes with some built in recognized gestures which may or may not have the option to customize and may be incovinient to use for a certain group of people (for example, I being a left handed person find it hard to play a car racing game with control keys in my right hand). This technology is named as \"LEAP\" and it was first introduced by HP into its laptops that use Leap Motion's gesture-based controller embedded directly inside the laptop to recognize the gestures. In this assignment, I am going to document my steps and show how can one transform any PC or laptop into a gesture controlled one in 1/100th the price of the original laptop with the built-in feature. Moreover, this gadget is totally customizeable so people with all demographics can choose the feature they want to control and how they want to control by just changing certain key association or the associated gesture. Although this model will require alot of training and trial and error in order to be as efficient as the in built leap laptops so for this assignment, we are only going to focus on how we can control some specific motions of our PC with gestures. These motions are described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective 1: Controlling the motions of a playing video:\n",
    "For this feature we are going to customize our gadget so that it can control all the features of a video playing chrome applications. These features include\n",
    "1. Pause/Play video\n",
    "2. Increase/decrease volume\n",
    "3. Fast forward/ rewind the video \n",
    "4. Exit the application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective 2: Control a Scratch Based game with gestures:\n",
    "For this part of the project I will create a simple scratch game and try to control its motion using my gestures. Scratch basically is a block-based visual programming language and website designed for children learn code. By using this language, people can create projects on the web using a block-like interface. I will use its visual programming feature to showcase myself playing the game and interacting with it in real time. I will convert the inputs from my sensors into keyboard commands and associate them with my game controls. The rationale behind using scratch to build the game is that they are very less complicated. And implementation of this gadget on a complex game (Asphalt 8, Need for speed etc) would require us to build an AI model that would have to be trained according to the maps, noise in the environment, and more complex gaming controls in order to be efficient enough to recognize the gestures and play the game smoothly. This will require alot of time and skills that I will be focusing on for my intended capstone next year. So considering these constraints, I will have to build my own simple game (for now) to serve the purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the paper I will also discuss how similar techniques can be extended and implemented on other PC controls and games. We will also discuss some alternative technologies that can be used to serve a similar purpose and their working such that you'll be able to differentiate between the approaches and their implementation. That being said, let's proceed towards the build up and circuit for the required robot. \n",

The Trig and echo pins of the sensors occupy pins 7,5 and 6,4 respectively. These will be used to send inputs to the Arduino board which will then be interpretted by python running locally on the machine.

    "The above code is the C++ implementation for the working prototype. In this code I first configured all the pins on the arduino board that have a particular sensor pin associated with it. Once the configuration is done, I specify that the trig pins of both the sensors are responsible for the outputs where as both the echo pins are associated with the sensor inputs. Once we have our inputs and outputs configured, I tell the sensor to generate ultrasonic signals for 2 microseconds and then turn on the output interface to receive these signals back. The total time used for these signals to leave the sensor and comeback is then used to calculate the total distance of the object placed infront of the sensors. Once the distance is calculated, it is stored in two variables distL and distR.Here I would like to mention my code calculates this distance for everytime a stimulus is sensed by the sensors, and updates the left and right distance variables. This is why I created the distance measuring function which can be called everytime the sensors sense a stimulus\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the distance, we now compare it with predefined values to specify certain metrics that will help us specify certain gestures. As for this identification, instead of using a particular distance value, I used a range between the values to increase the overall time taken to get the inputs. Once I have configured the inputs, I use them in the next section where I use python to associate these inputs with prefered outputs\n",

In simple robotics terms, I can term this part of my implementation to be the end effector that reacts to the stimulus in the environment and generates outputs which in this case are associations with keys on the key board. The stimulus , or in my case hands, are identified by the sensors according to the associated gesture. The actions are performed by creating a serial communication with arduino and then associate certain keyboard shortcuts with the incoming inputs. This is done by using python's pyautogyi module which lets our Python script to control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications.

    "## Analyses and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this paper, I documented my steps while creating and prototyping a sensor based gesture controlled computer. I tested the efficiency of my gadget, by putting it through 2 test, I first tried to control a video and all motions within that video, secondly, I tested a very similar approach on a scratch based game. Both the results show that my prototype is efficient enough and lets the user to control several different application with a bunch of already recognized gestures. That being said, we can extend upon this idea and create some more gestures that will help us control mouse opening and closing of browsers, scrolling etc. These text experiments show the potential of research that can be done into making such a product and how it can be made more efficient over time. Although there are a bunch of downfalls to this approch, one of which is that It is highly senitive so using the device on several different PC's would be very hard. Moreover,  it can only be used while the PC is positioned at a particular place and may require further calibration of sensors if moved to a new place. Its efficiency can also be increased by using high power sensors etc. but the overall cost associated with such a gadget is atmost $100 (mine cost 30) which is still 1/10th the cost of PC that has build in Leap technology."

    "#Robotics: Here I used this LO to create and implement a sensor based gadget that would enable its users to control the PC by simple gestures of hands. I also explained the build up by including circuit diagrams and simulated those circuits to test the accurate configuration and calibration of the sensors. Moreover, I implemented the circuit diagram and created a prototype of the said robot. I tested and explained the robot in two different applications with 2 different output results and also explained the potential of this gadget for more research. Additionally, I critiqued the prototype and suggested some ways this can be made more efficient\n",

    "#Simulation: Here I used this HC to create simulations for the working of my prototype. I used an online software known as tinkercad to devise the circuit and coded my arduino according to the accurate calubration of sensors with the least response time which made my prototype more efficient. I then tested this efficieny in a series of test and documented all my steps through it\n",
